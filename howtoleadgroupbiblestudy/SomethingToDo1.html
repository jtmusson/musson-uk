                    If you haven’t already thought of someone who is a model of leading group Bible study for you, I want to encourage you to be praying that God will help you to find someone.
                    However, there is a danger here. Finding a model leader doesn’t mean that you will aspire to be exactly like them: the chances are that you and they are very different.
                    So of course you will pick up ideas from the questions they’ve prepared and from the way they lead the conversation. But the aim, as you trust the Holy Spirit, is to lead group Bible study in a way that fits <i>your</i> style and <i>your</i> personality.
