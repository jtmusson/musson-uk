                                    asking themselves the question the disciples ask in verse 41.</td>

                    <div>Just a comment about the application of the passage (â†’). The application of this passage is not <i>Jesus can still the storms in our lives,</i> though that is true. But Mark didnâ€™t tell us this story to teach us that. Rather he tells the story so that we will see that Jesus is Lord and so that his readers ask themselves the question the disciples ask in verse 41.</div>
                    <div>Lastly, a couple of comments about this Swedish method of Bible study. I recommend it as a possible way for you, as leader, to start preparing: it gets you into the passage. </div>
                    <div>But itâ€™s obviously only one way in. I confess that I no longer use it very often myself.</div>
                    <div>The other thing to say is this. Sometimes people try to use the Swedish method in the small group meeting itself: the leader gives everyone a piece of paper with the symbols on it, and a pen. Then thereâ€™s 4 or 5 minutes of silence while everyone writes down their thoughts.</div>
                    <div>Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d recommend that. The danger is that some people feel under pressure: theyâ€™re afraid their answers are not going to be as good as othersâ€™ are. Sure, this might be less of a problem if people do this in pairs. But it can still feel a bit school-ish and off-putting.</div>
                    <div>So personally I would only ever use the Swedish method as a possible way for me, as leader, to start my preparation.</div>
