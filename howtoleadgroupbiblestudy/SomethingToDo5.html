                    <div>Of course I will have prepared more than two of each kind of question. These are simply examples of questions that I might well use.</div>

                    <div><b>Mark 4:35-41</b></div>
                    <div><i>Observation questions:</i></div>
                    <div>Q. What do we think might be going through the disciples’ minds when they wake Jesus in verse 38?</div>
                    <div>Q. How many surprises can we find in verse 39? Why do we think Jesus isn’t freaked out by the storm? How could we describe Jesus here (let’s make a list)?</div>
                    <div><i>Application questions:</i></div>
                    <div>Q. How do we think our attitude to Jesus should be different, now that we’ve seen his authority in action? What’s that going to mean for us in practice?</div>
                    <div>Q. We’ve all got friends who don’t believe in Jesus. How can we help them to get to the point where they ask themselves who Jesus is?</div>
                    <div><i>Starter question:</i></div>
                    <div>In pairs: Can we think of totally unexpected things (good things or bad things) that have completely thrown us off balance? How did we react at the time? (Then share with the group.)</div>
                    <div>You can see my full outline for leading a group Bible study on Mark 4:35-41 towards the end of the website.</div>
