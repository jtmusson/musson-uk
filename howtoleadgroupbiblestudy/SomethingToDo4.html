                    Something to do - 4
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <div>I realise that opinions differ as to what constitutes a good question and what constitutes a bad question: what helps <i>you</i> to dig into the passage and discover its meaning may not work for <i>me</i>. </div>
                    <div>But nevertheless it’s worth taking time to think about this. Here are my comments on the questions in <b>Something to do (4)</b>.</div>
                    <div class="greyBox">
                        <div class="greyBoxQ">Q. Why do we think the disciples still don’t recognise who Jesus is?</div>
                        <div class="greyBoxA">This is a good question. It’s in the present tense, which makes the whole thing more real; and <i>Why do we think..?</i> will relax people and make them more willing to share.</div>

                        <div class="greyBoxQ">Q. Why do we think the Pharisees are so against Jesus?</div>
                        <div class="greyBoxA">This is another good question: once again it’s in the present tense and it’s the kind of question that allows a <i>Why do we think..?</i></div>

                        <div class="greyBoxQ">Q. Extrapolate from this passage for your own lives.</div>
                        <div class="greyBoxA">This is a bad one. It sounds like an exam question, and it uses <i>your</i>, which reinforces the teacher-and-students feel: <i>our</i> would improve it. But how many people in the group are going to know what <i>extrapolate</i> means? (Not me – and I wrote the question!)</div>

                        <div class="greyBoxQ">Q. Who heals the woman in verse 29?</div>
                        <div class="greyBoxA">This is almost certainly a bad question. Of course, I don’t know what passage this is part of a Bible study on, but the answer is almost certainly going to be <i>Jesus</i>. So it’s embarrassingly easy: the group are probably going to clam up.</div>

                        <div class="greyBoxQ">Q. Do any of you know where Paul says something similar in one of his letters?</div>
                        <div class="greyBoxA">This question is bad, too. It uses <i>you</i>, so it’s got a teacher-and-students feel again, and is perhaps a bit patronising.</div>

                        <div class="greyBoxQ">Q. How do we think the Christians in Ephesus might have felt when this letter was read out?</div>
                        <div class="greyBoxA">This is a good question: it gets the group to think about the letter’s message and then to think about the possible reaction of the first hearers. The <i>we</i> is important: <i>you</i> would turn this into a bad question. If I’m allowed to be picky I’ll say that the question would be even better if it was in the present tense, to make it more immediate: <i>How do we think the Christians in Ephesus might be feeling as this letter is being read out?</i></div>
