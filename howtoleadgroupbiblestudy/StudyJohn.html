					<div class="pseudoList">1. What Jesus says at the beginning of the passage sounds like good news. Why don’t the crowd take it that way?</div>
					<div class="pseudoList">2. In verses 34-38 Jesus explains to the crowd that they need to be set free. How does he back that up? Do we think what Jesus says in verse 34 is true? Why?</div>
					<div class="pseudoList">3. Still in verses 34-38, what sin in particular does Jesus accuse the crowds of? How do we think they might have felt when he said that? Why do we think they wanted to do this?</div>
					<div class="pseudoList">4. In verse 37 Jesus obviously accepts that they are descendants of Abraham. But why should they <i>not</i> be calling themselves Abraham’s children?</div>
					<div class="pseudoList">5. Let’s look at verses 39-41. Jesus seems to be saying that we are the children of whoever we behave like. Who are the crowds behaving like?</div>
					<div class="pseudoList">6. In verses 42-47, what are some of the things Jesus says about the devil? Why do we think Jesus is being so blunt with the crowds? </div>
					
					<div><i>Scene Two: read verses 48-59</i></div>
					<div class="pseudoList">7. In verse 48 the crowds accuse Jesus of being demon-possessed. How does Jesus explain that this can’t be true?</div>
					<div class="pseudoList">8. Why are the crowds upset by what Jesus says in verse 51? Why can’t they believe that Jesus is greater than Abraham?</div>
					<div class="pseudoList">9. In verse 56 Jesus is rubbing it in. What do we think he means? And what does verse 57 tell us about what the crowds think of Jesus?</div>
					<div class="pseudoList">10. Let’s look at what Jesus says in verse 58. What would it mean if he had said ‘Before Abraham was born, I <i>was</i>’? Why are the crowds so angry that Jesus says ‘Before Abraham was born, I <i>am</i>’ (reading Exodus 3:13-14 may help!)</div>
					<div class="pseudoList">11. How do we know that the crowds think Jesus is blaspheming? Do we think Jesus slips away because he is afraid of dying?</div>
