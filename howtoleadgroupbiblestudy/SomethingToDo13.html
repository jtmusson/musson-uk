                    <div>Something else has occurred to me about <i>Question 3: How can I train others to lead group Bible study?</i></div>
                    <div>If you get the opportunity to train a group in a seminar kind of situation, here is a way of doing some of <i>Part Two: Lead wisely.</i></div>
                    <div>When looking at the problems that can crop up in a Bible study conversation (see <i>Dealing with the problems</i>, point c, page 40), I have used this role-play exercise: it’s fun and it creates good learning.</div>
                    <div>Show one person in the group a card with this message, and ask them if they would be willing to do this for you:</div>
                    <div><i>Please lead a discussion about different countries in Europe. Try to get everyone involved.</i></div>
                    <div><i>You might ask questions like</i></div>
                    <div>
                        <ul class="standardList">
                            <li><i>What are your favourite countries in Europe?</i></li>
                            <li><i>What’s the most beautiful European language?</i></li>
                            <li><i>What do we like best about different countries in Europe?</i></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div><i>I am telling everyone else in the group how I want them to behave during the discussion. Do your best to lead, but failure is almost guaranteed: it’s a very difficult group!</i></div>
                    <div>If they say Yes, you have your group leader. </div>
                    <div>Now hand out the following cards to the rest of the group members, telling them that X is going to lead a discussion about countries in Europe. Ask them not to show what’s on their card to anyone else.</div>
                    <ul class="standardList">
                        <li>You try to take over the leadership of the group. So you say things like <i>I think a better question would be about the food in different countries!</i></li>
                        <li>You don’t get on with Phil (write the name of someone else in the group here – but not the leader’s). Whatever they say, you contradict it: eg <i>That’s really stupid!</i></li>
                        <li>All you want to talk about is Italy. You keep trying to get everyone talking about Italy. You might say things like <i>No, Italy’s much better</i> or <i>But Italians are the most exciting people in Europe!</i></li>
                        <li>You’re very shy: you don’t say anything, and you look at your feet the whole time. If you are asked a direct question, give a one-word answer if possible.</li>
                        <li>You are the perfect group member! You support the leader and join in with the conversation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div>If there are more than 6 people in your group, the others can stand round the outside of the circle and enjoy the show!</div>
                    <div>After this has gone on for 5 minutes or so (or longer, if the group are doing well with their roles), close the role-play down. Congratulate the leader for coping with an impossible job and lead the applause for them. </div>
                    <div>Now go round the group one by one, as follows:</div>
                    <ul class="standardList">
                        <li><i>What do we think Alice has on her card?</i></li>
                        <li><i>What should we do if someone behaves like this in a group Bible study?</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <div>Doing this as a role-play is fun, but it also provides the opportunity to talk about all the different issues that can crop up during a Bible study conversation. And the advantage of having different countries in Europe as the topic is that it avoids making fun of a Bible study. </div>
