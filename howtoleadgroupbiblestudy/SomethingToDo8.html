                    <div>Here are a few more thoughts from me about the seven qualities of a good Bible study group leader:</div>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>a growing disciple</dt>
                        <dd>I still remember the impact it had on me when I realised that I was in a group where the leader loved us…</dd>
                        <dt>enthusiastic</dt>
                        <dd>When I’m nervous (whatever the situation I’m in), I come over as unengaged and unenthusiastic. So I make a particular effort to be positive and enthusiastic. And when I see other people responding to this, the nerves often start to go…</dd>
                        <dt>encouraging</dt>
                        <dd>A friend of mine who read through the book before publication to give me his comments wasn’t sure whether to believe my story about the Bible study group at a conference for A-level students. But it’s true: I really did this. You might not want to do it with your group, but you could try it with a few friends. I recommend it! </dd>
                        <dt>watchful</dt>
                        <dd>What makes it easier to be watchful is having notes which are very clear. This will mean that I only need to glance down at my questions occasionally. Which means I can give my attention to the group…</dd>
                        <dt>flexible</dt>
                        <dd>What’s going to make it easier to be flexible is talking to the Lord (silently!) during the study…</dd>
                        <dt>inclusive</dt>
                        <dd>The idea of getting the group to talk about something in pairs works well. But not if  the meeting is happening online: see the Appendix, Question 2.</dd>
                        <dt>honest</dt>
                        <dd>I don’t know why we’re sometimes embarrassed to admit that we don’t understand something: I guess it’s just a misunderstanding of what leadership involves. Whereas if we open up about our own struggles, it can help others to be honest too…</dd>
