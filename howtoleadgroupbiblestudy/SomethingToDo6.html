                    <div>Obviously it is up to you how much you take on board of what I have written about things to do before the small-group meeting.</div>

                        <dd>This is so obvious. But I wrote it again because I think that all of us as leaders are prone to cutting corners.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>b.	Pray</dt>
                        <dd>Let me stress the value of praying for each individual who you think might come to the group: these can be short prayers, but the fact that you pray them shows that you care about everyone.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>c.	Put the chairs in a circle</dt>
                        <dd>I know this is hardly ever going to be a perfect circle! But I hope you get the point: it makes a massive difference if you can see everyone, and if each member of the group can see everyone else.</dd>
                        
                        <dt>d.	Create a relaxed atmosphere</dt>
