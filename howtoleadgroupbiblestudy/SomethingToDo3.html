                    <div>I find one-sentence summaries difficult.</div>
                    <div>I suggest this for Mark 4:35-41. As it’s a narrative passage, this summarises what happens in the story: <i>When the boat Jesus and his disciples are in is caught up in a violent storm, Jesus’ immense authority in suddenly calming the storm causes the disciples to ask themselves who he is.</i></div>
                    <div>You can’t get every detail into a summary: if you insist on that you could just as well copy out the whole passage!</div>
                    <div>I think that summary is OK, but you may well have done a better job. </div>
                    <div>What won’t do for part of the summary of Mark 4:35-41 is something along the lines of <i>and so the disciples learn that he can calm all the storms we ever meet in life</i>. </div>
                    <div>See my comments near the end of <b>Something to do (2)</b> for why. </div>
