  <br>I hope you  have read John 13:1-17. You will probably have written down something like  this:<br><br>
  <strong>Q1. What was the  original meaning?</strong><br><br>
  <strong>a. Why did the writer  write this book?</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  key verses here are John 20:30-31, where John tells us why he wrote his Gospel.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  another answer is fine too: John wrote because he wanted us to know the truth about  Jesus. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  does not mean that I am going to read John 20:30-31 whenever I preach from John&rsquo;s  Gospel!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in my preparation this will help me to understand the original meaning  of the passage I am going to teach. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>b. Why did he write  these verses?</strong><br>
  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>John doesn&rsquo;t tell us in as many words. But  there are a number of possible answers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
  he  begins to tell us about the full extent of Jesus&rsquo; love (v1), John shows us that  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus&rsquo;  greatness,  far from excluding servanthood, actually involves it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so different 
  from  the usual human understanding of greatness.<br> 
  <br>
  <strong>c. What do the individual words mean?</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am going to have to think about the meaning of the following words, phrases <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 
  concepts (and you may have found more than I have listed here):<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passover;  the hour<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the devil had prompted Judas<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;footwashing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;you  have no part with me&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v10&nbsp;&nbsp;a bath;  clean<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v14&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;you  should wash one another&rsquo;s feet&rsquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v17&nbsp;&nbsp;blessed </p>
