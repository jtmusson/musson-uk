<br>I cannot  tell you what your answers should be here! </span></p>
<p class="Font_"><span class="Font_">But I do  want to encourage you to think and pray about who your one or two models of  Bible teaching might be. </span></p>
<p class="Font_"><span class="Font_">You might  borrow or buy one of John Stott&rsquo;s books in IVP&rsquo;s <em>The Bible Speaks Today </em>series. Obviously a book is not the same as  a Bible talk, but this may help nevertheless. </span></p>
<p class="Font_"><span class="Font_">Of course  you could always ask some friends for suggestions of possible Bible teaching  models. </span></p>
