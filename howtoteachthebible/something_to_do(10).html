<br>This suggested conclusion of a Bible talk on  John 13:1-17 would be more effective if it was linked with a specific  structure-with-headings. </span></p>

<br>So we have been looking at Jesus: he knows who he is and why he has come.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the Lord.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let&rsquo;s worship him. Let&rsquo;s thank him for loving <em>us </em>to the end.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let&rsquo;s thank him for his extraordinary love in washing the disciples&rsquo; feet.
<br>And we&rsquo;ve been listening to Jesus too. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has told us to serve one another.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Holy Spirit saying to you?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there things he is calling you to do in these next few days? 
<br>Jesus is here. Let&rsquo;s worship him. And let&rsquo;s obey him. 
Let&rsquo;s pray together. </span></pre>
