<br>We are  still in John 13:1-17. Your answers may look like something like this:<br>
<strong><br>Q2. What is the  universal meaning?</strong> <br>
<strong><br>What lessons and  principles are there in this text which are true in every culture and in every  century?</strong><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus&rsquo; lordship includes the humility of  servanthood (v3-5)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should let Jesus serve us (v8-9)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone has been forgiven by Jesus it is  as if they have had a bath (v10)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are followers of Jesus should serve  one another (v14-15)</span></p>
<p class="Font_"><span class="Font_">All of  those things are important. But perhaps the one lesson John wants to stress  more than all the others is the last, because this is the emphasis of the  climax of the passage in verses 12-17.</span></p>
