<br>Here are two suggestions of how the  introduction to a Bible talk on John 13:1-17 might look.</p>
<p class="Font_">You will notice that one of these suggestions  builds the bridge from the Bible passage to the listeners, while the other  builds it from the listeners to the Bible passage. </p>
<p class="Font_">The problem with both these suggestions is that  they are not linked to a specific structure-with-headings.<span class="Font_"><em><br><br><br>
  <strong>Suggestion One</strong></em><br>
  <br>
  Chapter 13 of the Gospel is the beginning of the last section of the story John wants to tell us. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  is the climax.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  have seen and heard Jesus in action.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now  we are going to look at the final stage of the story: Jesus is going to his  death.<br>
<br>And how does John begin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  shows us that the Lord of glory was willing to wash his disciples&rsquo; feet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  that those of us who follow him should do the same.
    <br><br><br>
  <strong><em>Suggestion Two</em></strong><em></em></em><br>
  <br>Have you ever asked yourself this question? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  trust in Jesus. Well, how does he want me to live? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s  what this passage in John&rsquo;s Gospel is about. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  you are a Christian and you want to live for Jesus, this is the passage to look  at.<br><br>
  Chapter 13 is the beginning of the last stage  of the Jesus story.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus  is soon going to be arrested, tried and crucified. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  first John tells us how Jesus followers should live.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  he does that by showing us Jesus washing his disciples&rsquo; feet.</span>
