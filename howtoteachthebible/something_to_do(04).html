  <br>
  The principle we are concentrating on here is  that Christians should serve one another. Remember that application means that  we are looking for practical examples.</span></p>
<p class="Font_"><span class="Font_"><strong><br>Imagine you are  teaching pensioners. What might be some possible applications?</strong><br>
  <br>Here are some suggestions:<br>
  You could think of pensioners who  live near you who need help: you might offer to go shopping with them, or, if they are  ill or very weak, to do their shopping for them.<br>
  You could ask some families or  singles in the church how you could pray for them regularly.<br>
  If you are physically up to it, you  could offer to help with the tea and coffee after services on a Sunday. </span></p>
<p class="Font_"><span class="Font_"><strong><br>Imagine you are  teaching teenagers. What might be some practical applications?</strong><br>
  <br>Here are some suggestions:<br>
  Can  you think of someone in your class at school who struggles with maths that you find  quite easy?  Although they are not really a friend of yours, you might offer to spend half an hour helping them to understand something they find hard. You could volunteer to help wash up at the end of the next youth group meeting. Why not astonish your mother by asking if she wants a bit of help with the shopping?!</span></p>
